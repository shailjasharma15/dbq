### ABOUT TEQIP-III

The Technical Education Quality Improvement Programme
(TEQIP) was launched in December 2012, by the Ministry
of Human Resource Development with assistance from
the World Bank. The programme was conceived and
designed as a long-term project to be implemented in
10-12 years in 3 phases in order to support excellence and
transformation in technical education in the country. The
third phase of the programme (TEQIP-III) was started in
2019. The main objective of TEQIP-III is to improve the
quality of engineering education in the existing government
institutions, in the educationally backward states and also
arrange for twining them with other institutes.

### ABOUT THE WORKSHOP

The functioning of any individual or an organisation is dependent on
documentation. Can you imagine any one of the above is finalised in a single shot, or only one
person is involved in giving it a final shape?

No, a big **NO**. That never happens. Even a small document, like an office memo or a
notice undergoes a number of revisions and every task involves multiple
persons.

Same is the case with any publication, technical report, research report,
thesis, academic report, convocation address.

Most of us, most of the time maintaining various revisions by giving
appropriate names, and sending latest edition / version
to other involved (through pen-drive or e-mails) for incorporating in their
work or for review.

Is this the right approach?

Definitely no.

There are always challenges of making it sure that latest changes or inputs
from all team members have been incorporated in the final report.

What is the way out?

This workshop will be the answer.

This Skill Development Training will give you all the necessary tools, hands-on 
practical sessions to solve all these issues, and making sure that computer resources 
are used efficiently (thus making the process **green**) and with the provision to track
who proposed the changes or who drafted what and who approved that, later any
time, and roll-back, if there is necessity of that.

## Why is Version Control Important?

1. It is important when documents that are being created have to undergo a
lot of revisions and redrafting by a number of different officials.
1. It helps us to track changes and identify when key decisions were made
along the way.
1. It helps to easily find out which version of a document is currently in
force, or which version of a policy was in use at a particular time.

Revision or version control systems form good records keeping practice
which is mandatory conditions for all ISO 9001 certified organisations.

### TOPICS TO BE COVERED

### EXPECTED OUTCOME

Followings will be the benefits to attendees of the workshop:

1. Learn to manage version control of every document easily, making it easy
to explore the changes that occurred to it at different points of time.
1. Learn to keep all files necessary for a particular project in a central
place (repository), and give access to authorised persons, with tracking ability.
To that central repository team members can add documents, images, links,
graphs, etc.
1. Learn to review other people’s documents, add comments to certain lines
or the overall document, and suggest changes.
1. Learn to maintain online backup of data. Everyone who has rights can
access the data.
1. Learn the ways to reduce usage of computer resources to make the process
energy efficient (green).
